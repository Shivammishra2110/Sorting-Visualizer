# Sorting-Visualizer

The Sorting Visualizer project is a web-based application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. Sorting algorithms are essential techniques used in computer science to arrange elements in a specific order within a data structure. This project aims to provide an interactive and educational platform to demonstrate the inner workings of popular sorting algorithms.

Key Features:

Array Generation: Users can generate arrays of different sizes, and the elements in these arrays are represented as bars on the screen.

Algorithm Selection: The application allows users to choose from a variety of sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

Animation: When a sorting algorithm is chosen, the application visualizes the sorting process through animated bars, demonstrating how the algorithm rearranges the elements step-by-step to achieve the final sorted order.

Time and Space Complexity: The application displays the time and space complexity of each sorting algorithm, providing users with valuable insights into the efficiency and performance characteristics of different algorithms.
